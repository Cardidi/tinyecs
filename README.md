# TinyECS - State First ECS Toolkit

TinyECS is a lightweight, easy-to-use Entity-Component-System (ECS) implementation designed for C#-based game applications. By combining ComponentStore and EntityGraph, it strikes an effective balance between flexibility and performance.

Unlike a full application framework, TinyECS is built for seamless integration. It can coexist alongside other ECS solutions, such as UnityECS, allowing you to incorporate it into existing projects with minimal friction.

The toolkit's design was refined through the successful development of a round-based game, making TinyECS inherently focused on efficient and robust state management for state-driven scenarios.
